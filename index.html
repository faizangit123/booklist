No wonder people swarm in flies all year round to witness the magnificence of his beauty. This monument is located in India in the city of Agra in Uttar Pradesh. In other words, Taj Mahal marks the excellence of Mughal architecture.The renowned Taj Mahal was brought to life by the vision of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. He got this monument built for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal after she passed away.

                To honor the memory of his loving wife, Shah Jahan ordered the finest artisans from all over the world to build it. He wanted to make something that had never been done before for anyone. The emperor wished to give the last gift to his wife whom he loved very much.
                
                Even till date, people sing praises about Shah Jahan’s grand gesture. It makes you believe in love and appreciate it like never before. We also see how under the tomb lies the body of the eternal lovers. Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal are buried next to each other and even after death, they remained side by side.
